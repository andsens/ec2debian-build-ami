# ec2debian-build-ami has been renamed to [build-debian-cloud](https://github.com/andsens/build-debian-cloud) #

Over the past few months there has been much interest in using the architecture and ideas of this tool for
other cloud platforms like Google Compute Engine and virtualized environments like VirtualBox as well.

Hopefully this generalization sparks the interest of even more developers to begin creating new plugins
or adaptors for other cloud providers.
